To effectively address this type of error, ensure you've meticulously followed the library's installation guide.  Common issues include:

1. **Incorrect Installation:** Verify that you've used the correct command (npm install or yarn add) and that the library is listed in your `package.json` file.  Sometimes, using `npx pod-install` (for iOS) may be needed after installing native dependencies.
2. **Missing Dependencies:** Many libraries depend on other packages.  Check the library's documentation for any required dependencies and install them as well.
3. **Linking Issues (Native Modules):** If the library has native modules (for iOS or Android), make sure they are properly linked to your project.  For iOS, you may need to open the project in Xcode and perform manual linking.  For Android, look into the specific instructions for your library.
4. **Version Compatibility:** Ensure that the library is compatible with your version of React Native.  Version conflicts can cause unpredictable behavior.
5. **Import Errors:** Double-check that you are importing the library correctly in your component.  The correct import path depends on the library's structure.
6. **Incorrect Usage:** Refer to the library's documentation to confirm that you are using the library's APIs and functions correctly.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's assume a library called 'react-native-uncommon-lib' is causing the problem.  Incorrect implementation:

```javascript
// UncommonLibraryBug.js
import UncommonLib from 'react-native-uncommon-lib'; // Incorrect import or missing dependency

// ...rest of the component
```

Corrected implementation:

```javascript
// UncommonLibrarySolution.js
import UncommonLib from 'react-native-uncommon-lib'; // Correct import (assuming path is correct)

// ...rest of the component, ensure correct usage of UncommonLib APIs based on documentation
```

By systematically addressing these points, you can pinpoint the root cause of your integration problem and get the library working as intended.
