This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky bug in React Native applications: integration issues with third-party libraries.  The bug showcases a scenario where a library is seemingly installed, but fails to function correctly during runtime, often resulting in unclear error messages.  The solution demonstrates best practices for integrating third-party dependencies in React Native to help prevent such issues.  This example focuses on debugging and resolution techniques rather than specific library implementations.
